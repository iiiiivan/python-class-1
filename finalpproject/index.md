        - 1,2, or 3 bullets
    - Grenade
    - Flying Faster
   
   - Parallax Effect
    - moving background clouds
    - at least 3 layers, front layers move faster

   - Start Screen

   - Different Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) Settings

   - Keep Highscore

   - Level gets harder as time goes on.

We lose if we touch a pipe/enemy.
How do we win? We keep playing as long as possible.

What are our sprites?

- Bird
- Pipe
- PowerUp
- Background, Middleground
- Enemy

What are our labels?

- Time
- CurrentScore
- HighScore


## Plan

    [x] Scrolling Background
    [x] Enemy
    
Day 2:
    [x] Make the enemy move up and down
    [x] Enemy shoot at the bird
    [x] Give the Player 10 lives
    [x] Add a Label for the PlayerLife
    [x] Subtract a life each time a EnemyBullet touches the player
    [x] Make the game easier at start and get progressively harder
    [x] Time
    [x] Reading highscore from a file
    

Day 3:
